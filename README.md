 * Jupyter notebook [integral_trace_num.ipynb](./integral_trace_num.ipynb) numerically checks the equality established in Lemma 5.1
 * Jupyter notebook [numerics.ipynb](./numerics.ipynb) computes numerical approximations to certain integrals, whose convergence is discussed in Propositions 5.6 and 5.10
